Reconzo COD Reconciliation
This project is part of my internship selection assignment for Reconzo. It involves cleaning and reconciling Cash on Delivery (COD) data from various courier partners against order-level data provided by the seller. The final report is built in Power BI, with data preparation and cleaning handled using Python (Pandas).
